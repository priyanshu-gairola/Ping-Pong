# 🏓 Python Turtle Ping Pong Game

A throwback to childhood afternoons — this Ping Pong game is built with Python's Turtle graphics module and a lot of nostalgic vibes! Whether you called it Pong, Table Tennis, or "that one game with paddles," this mini project recreates that pixelated magic... one turtle step at a time.

## 🎮 Features

- Two-player mode (keyboard-controlled)
- Ball bouncing like it's 1995
- Score tracking (no more arguing who won!)
- Minimal design, maximum retro feel
- Built entirely using Python's built-in `turtle` module — no extra installs needed!

## 🧠 Why I Made This

Just learning Python and Turtle graphics... and somehow ended up building a game that ate half my childhood. Pure muscle memory coded into pixels.

## ⌨️ Controls

**Player A (Left Paddle):**
- `W` – Move Up
- `S` – Move Down

**Player B (Right Paddle):**
- `Up Arrow` – Move Up
- `Down Arrow` – Move Down

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. No external libraries required — just good ol' `turtle`.
3. Run the Python file:

```bash
python ping_pong.py
